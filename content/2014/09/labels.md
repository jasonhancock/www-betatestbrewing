You have a lot of options when it comes to labeling bottled homebrewed beers.

* Write on the cap with a permanent marker
    * **PROS:** cheap; easy
    * **CONS:** if your handwriting is anything like mine, it might be hard to read. If you are entering beers in competitions, you will have to black out the entire cap with a permanent marker. Writing on 48 caps is tedious
* Use a reusable label like a [GrogTag](http://www.grogtag.com/)
    * **PROS:** professional looking
    * **CONS:** expensive
* Print your own labels and attach them to the bottles with skim milk
    * **PROS:** relatively inexpensive, professional looking results
    * **CONS:** time consuming; I'm not much of a graphic designer; will fall off if left in an ice chest
* Print small Avery labels and attach to the caps
    * **PROS:** easy to read; cheap; easy to attach; won't fall off in an ice chest if the bottles are upright; easy to remove if entering bottles in a competition; no sticky residue to remove from the bottles
    * **CONS:** none that I can think of

I use [Avery 5408](http://amzn.to/1tGHj3Z) labels and print them on my laser printer. They will work with ink jet printers as well. The labels come 1008 to a pack, and at the time of this writing a pack costs $5.33 on Amazon, making each label cost about half a penny each.

Avery has a downloadable template on their website, or you can use the [template]({filename}/assets/docs/2014/09/label_template.doc) I put together.

**Finished product:**
