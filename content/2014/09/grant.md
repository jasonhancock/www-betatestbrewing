Title: Adding a wort grant to my home brewery

I'm in the process of rebuilding my home brewery and moving from a five gallon Rubbermaid cooler based system to a ten gallon, all stainless, HERMS system.

The biggest benefit I'm hoping to achieve by recirculating my mash is temperature control. I've noticed that when brewing beers at higher mash temperatures (156 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit), that I loose a few degrees over the course of an hour and I end up with a more fermentable wort than I desired which contributes to a thinner body than the style of beer may have called for.

Anyhow, what is a grant and what would motivate me to build one? A grant is a device that can help prevent a stuck mash by preventing your pump from pulling vacuum on the grain bed. When recirculating your mash without a grant, you run a hose from the output valve of your mash tun to the input of your pump. This means that the pump could collapse your grain bed should it pull vacuum resulting in a stuck mash. When you add a grant to the system, you gravity feed wort from the mash tun into the grant, then hook the input side of the pump up to the output of the grant.

Some grants are very sophisticated and include a float switch to automatically turn off the pump should the grant run dry. At the homebrew scale, this really isn't necessary if you keep a close eye on the level of wort in the grant and thus I have not incorporated a float switch in my design.

Before we get started, my standard [disclaimer]({filename}/pages/disclaimer.md) applies.

## Tools

* 3/8" drill
* [Step up drill bit](http://amzn.to/1uMuJjD)
* [Cutting fluid](http://amzn.to/1AVZQt9)
* Square
* Tape measure
* A file or Dremel tool to clean up any rough edges
* Teflon tape

## Parts

* [1/3 size food service pan](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/1-3-size-standard-weight-stainless-steel-anti-jam-steam-table-hotel-pan-6-deep/4070369.html)
* [1/3 size clear food pan lid with spoon notch](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/carlisle-10271u07-topnotch-1-3-size-universal-handled-lid-with-spoon-notch/70030N.html) (perfectly fits the 1/2" high temp silicon hose I use)
* [Weldless bulkhead fitting](http://amzn.to/1uMuJjD)
* [1/2" stainless nipple](http://amzn.to/1r8oWm2)
* [1/2" Full port stainless ball valve](http://amzn.to/1o9Gn2q)

Depending on the types of disconnect fittings you use in your brewery, you will need one of the following:

* Camlock type F fitting
* 1/2" MPT to hose nipple
* Some other type of quick disconnect fitting (tri-clover, regular quick disconnects, etc.)

I use camlocks in my brewery. I get them exclusively from Bobby at
[BrewHardware.com](http://brewhardware.com).

## Assembly

Using the tape measure and square, drill a hole near one end of the food service pan large enough to accomodate your bulkhead fitting.

Using a file or a Dremel tool, clean up any rough edges or burrs around the edge of the hole.

Install the bulkhead fitting into the hole.

Install the stainless nipple and ball valve to the bulkhead using teflon tape to ensure a good seal.

Install a camlock, nipple, or other quick disconnect to the ball valve.

Install the grant onto a brew stand or other structure such that you can gravity feed from the mash tun into the grant, then from the grant to your pump.

## How to use

After mashing in, attach a hose from the output of your mash tun into your grant. You want to minimize splashing, so the length of tubing should reach to the bottom of the grant. Once the grant is about halfway full, turn on your pump. You want to match the flow out of the pump to the flow out of the mash tun such that there is a constant volume of wort in the grant. This means you will have to adjust the valve on the output side of the pump. It may take a little time to dial it in. Once you have it set up you can sit back confident that you won't stick your mash (at least not caused by your pump).
