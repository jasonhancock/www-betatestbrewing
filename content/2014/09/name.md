Beta Test Brewing Company was chosen as the name of my home brewery after being
recommended by a friend. I'm a software enginner/systems administrator/Linux geek
by trade and wanted to find a name that reflected that aspect of my life in some
manner. The name is also fitting as one day I hope to "Go Pro" and open a
commercial brewery, so in essence everything I'm doing now is just a beta test.
