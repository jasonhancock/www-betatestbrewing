I like to whirlpool my wort to help drop the solids out of suspension into a nice cone in the center of the kettle. I used to simply clamp a piece of 1/2" ID silicone hose and do my best to position it so that I could get a nice whirlpool going, but I wanted something better. My kettle has a 1/2" NPT port for a thermometer that I don't use, so I considered rigging something though that port, but I didn't like that idea. Instead, I wanted to add a whirlpool arm that I could somehow clamp to the side of the kettle.

I really didn't know what to do until someone posted a picture in a Facebook group of their setup. They were using a beam clamp and some stainless tubing and it was exactly what I wanted.

### Parts List:

* 1 x [Beam Clamp](http://www.mcmaster.com/#30015t31)
* 1 x [1/2" MPT x 1/2" tubing compression fitting](http://www.stainlessbrewing.com/Compression-x-MPT-SS_p_92.html)
* 1 x [1/2" Camlock Type A](http://www.stainlessbrewing.com/Type-A-Camlock_p_61.html)
* 1 x [1/2" Stainless racking cane with extra bend](http://www.stainlessbrewing.com/SS-Racking-Cane_p_43.html)
* 1 x 1" piece of 1/2" ID silicone tubing
* Teflon tape

When I ordered the racking cane, I specified this for the extra bend:

> I'd like a 90 degree bend at the bottom of the cane. I'm going to be using this
> as a whirlpool arm. The kettle I'll be using it in is 21" tall. It looks like
> the racking canes are usually 24" tall, and if the last few inches are bent
> (making it somewhere around 20" tall bend-to-bend) it should work out just fine.
