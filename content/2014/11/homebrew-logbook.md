Keeping accurate notes is essential to homebrewing. It's important to know what
you did, how you did it, etc.

I use Beersmith to forumulate my recipes, but I don't use it as my system-of-record
as to what was brewed. For that I prefer a bound notebook that I fill out in
ink on brew day. I use [this notebook](http://amzn.to/1uMZRQN) to keep track of
everything. It has spaces for the recipe, brewing notes, fermentation notes,
bottling/packaging notes, tasting notes, and spots for various stats like
OG/FG, fermentation temperatures, etc.

Here's an example of the fermentation and bottling notes that I took for an IPA
I recently brewed:
