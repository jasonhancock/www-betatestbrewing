Summary: Homebrewing tools and calculators

* [ABV Calculator]({filename}/pages/abv.html) - Calculates ABV, apparent attenuation, and calories
* [Random BJCP Style]({filename}/pages/random.html) - Picks a random BJCP style from the 2008 BJCP style guide. This was built after my homebrew club had a hard time picking a style of beer for our quarterly competition.
