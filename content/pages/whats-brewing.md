Summary: What I currently have brewing, fermenting, and brews on-deck.

## Fermenting:

* v3.0 of my Pale Ale, brewed 1/4/2013. Completely new grain bill as I was
unhappy with the last two iterations.

## Conditioning in Bottles:

* Rye IPA
* Black IPA
* Pale Ale 2.0
* Cranberry Apple Cider

## Brews on Deck:

* Hefeweizen (For March 2015 [HTBA](http://horsethiefbrewers.com) internal blind
competition)
* v2.0 Honey and Black Pepper Saison - I want to try using cheap clover honey instead
of the expensive orange-blossom honey to see if I can tell the difference
* Redemption Brown Ale - I was unhappy with how my last brown ale turned out
* Tripel
