Before I set goals for 2017, let's check in and see how I did on my [2016 goals]({filename}/2016/01/brewyear-resolutions.md). The goals were:

* Brew a beer in excess of 11.5% ABV
* Brew a lager
* Complete my e-HERMS by getting a larger mash tun
* Brew a session IPA
* One blog post a month

I was able to hit three of my five goals. I brewed my "Barbed Wire Belgian" beer that turned out to be 12.2% ABV. I brewed an Oktoberfest lager (that I then took first place with in a competition). I purchased a larger mash tun (20 gallons).

I did not brew a session IPA nor was I able to post to this blog once a month. I could make excuses, but honestly, brewing has become more of a chore than something I genuinely enjoy, so I've been brewing a lot less.

My goals for 2017:

* Due to changes in circumstances, I need to acquire a kettle so I can brew again
* Brew a session IPA
* Rediscover my joy of brewing

I'm intentionally setting the bar low this year.
