The National Homebrew Conference is being held on the west coast this year! I've
secured a spot to attend, and my club may be pouring one night during the
conference.

I've also submitted two beers to the national competition. I've submitted my
Pale Ale (version 3.0) and my Saison (version 2.0). I'm hoping the pale ale does
well. I don't think the saison will do well because it lacks a bit of complexity.
I'm looking forward to getting my scoresheets back.

If you're going to be at the NHC in June and want to say hello, drop me a line
at [@jsnby](https://twitter.com/jsnby) on Twitter or an
[email](http://geek.jasonhancock.com/contact/) through my blog.
