Now that I'm kegging and don't have to worry about the amount of yeast left
suspended in my beer, I decided it was time to try fining with gelatin to
achieve that commercial clarity that is so highly sought after.

I followed the [Brulosopher's method](http://brulosophy.com/2015/01/05/the-gelatin-effect-exbeeriment-results/)
and added 1/2 tsp. [Knoxx unflavored gelatin](http://amzn.to/1HXMpSy) to 1/4
cup cold water and then microwaved in short bursts until it reached 140-150
degrees F. In my microwave, that ended up equating to about 24 seconds. My beer
had been cold crashing for about 18 hours prior to adding the gelatin. I'll keg
it and force carbonate it tomorrow and hopefully have a clear beer to drink by
Thursday.
