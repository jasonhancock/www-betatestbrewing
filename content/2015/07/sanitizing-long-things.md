Sanitizing long instruments (spoons, auto-siphons, etc.) is always a pain. I was
using a wall paper glue tray, but it wasn't quite long enough and my auto-siphon
would stick out of one end.

When looking for a solution, I stumbled across the idea to use a windosill
planter box instead of the wall paper tray. I was unable to locate a suitable
vessle at either my local Home Depot or Lowes, so I started looking around
online.

I found [this one](http://amzn.to/1fMvy93) on Amazon and it works perfectly for
my needs as it is 36" long and sealed on the bottom.
