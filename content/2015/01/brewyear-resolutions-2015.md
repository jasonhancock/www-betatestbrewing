2015 is here! I like to create goals so that I have something to work towards. For 2015, I'm goign to declare some Brew Year's resolutions:

* Water Chemistry: I'd like to learn more about how water chemistry affects my brewing. I'm going to start by reading [Water](http://amzn.to/1xayId0) from the [Brewing Elements](http://amzn.to/1z1fAgQ) series
* e-HERMS: Complete my e-HERMS build
* Brew a high gravity ale (OG at least 1.100). To date, my highest OG has been 1.090. I'm brewing a barleywine today, so I hope to achieve this goal today.
