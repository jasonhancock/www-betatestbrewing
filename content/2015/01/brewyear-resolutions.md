2015 is here! I like to create goals so that I have something to work towards.
For 2015, I'm going to declare some Brew Year's resolutions:

* Water Chemistry: I'd like to learn more about how water chemistry affects my
brewing. I'm going to start by reading [Water](http://amzn.to/1xayId0) from the
[Brewing Elements](http://amzn.to/1z1fAgQ) series
* e-HERMS: Complete my e-HERMS build
* Brew a high gravity ale (OG at least 1.100). To date, my highest OG has been
1.090.
* Brew a lager. The idea of brewing a lager intimidates me for some unknown reason.
* Dial in my pale ale recipe. I've brewed it twice, adjusting the recipe each
time. Both versions have received honors in BJCP sanctioned competitions. I
really want to dial in this recipe and bring home a first place ribbon.
