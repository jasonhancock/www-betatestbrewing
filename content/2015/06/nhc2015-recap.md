NHC 2015 was a blast. Great content, great people, and great beer!

My club, the [Horse Thief Brewers Association](http://horsethiefbrewers.com),
poured during social club on Friday. All of our beers seemed to be well
received. The beer judging application I built ([judge.beer](https://judge.beer))
was on display via a monitor and Raspberry Pi and attendees were asked to rank
our beers. Sadly, participation wasn't great, but a couple of people did sign up
after I explained how we use the app to streamline our club meetings.

The expo hall was packed with a bunch of vendors and breweries. If your glass was
empty at any point, you only needed to turn to the nearest booth to get it
refilled.

The keynote by Tomme Arthur of Port Brewing/The Lost Abbey was awesome. It
captured the spirit of homebrewing and was met with a standing ovation.

All of the sessions I attended were excellent. I learned a lot about acid beers,
sour mashing/worting, adding coffee to beer, organizing clubs, malt, and several
other topics.

All I can say is that if you have the opportunity to attend next year's NHC in
Baltimore, take it!
